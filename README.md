This repo in due time shall contain notebooks with exercises demonstrating various methods of validating ML models
Validating Logistic Regression model: Decile Analysis
The main focus of this exercise is to use **decile analysis** to evalute the performance of a **logistic regression** model.
This will include **decile chart** and **lift chart** and their visualizations.
Binary classifications also use the **Area Under Curve (AUC)** and the **Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (KS) distance** to evaluate the model. 
We shall also calculate and interpret these statistics.
